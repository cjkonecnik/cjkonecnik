<p id="about">
Chris has been flying since 2006, though he didn't start formal flight training until his senior year of high school in 2013. In 2017, he graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor's degree in Professional Flight. Today, he is a First Officer in the CRJ series of aircraft at PSA Airlines and is based in Dayton, Ohio.

While in college, Chris began practicing Minimalism by trimming his clothing down to a single outfit, which he wore every day of the year. Since then, he has set his focus on purchasing better quality clothing that enables him to wear fewer articles for longer periods of time. He has also expanded this philosophy to include all of the things in his life (both digital and physical). His mobile lifestyle as a pilot allows him to finesse this practice.
  </br>
  </br>
Chris is also a devout Tesla fan and recently took ownership of a brand new Tesla Model 3. He had followed the Tesla brand closely since its inception and finally reached a point where he could turn his dream of one day owning one into a reality. Chris uses his car to spread his love of technology and the planet to his friends, coworkers, and loved ones.
